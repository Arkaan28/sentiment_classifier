# sentiment_classifier
This project aims to classify the tweets based on the type of words used in the tweet by various people. There are 2 files containing the positive and negative words and based on these words the tweet can be classfied as negative or positive. 
The resulting data is saved in the file resulting_data.csv containing the following things about the tweet 'Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score, Negative Score, Net Score.'
The file containing the data of tweets is project_twitter_data.csv. Each line in this file is a tweet. The file that contains the code is sentiment_classifier.py. You can replace the tweets in the project_twitter_data.csv file but keep in mind that it has to be in the csv format. Also, you can add words into positive and negative words file to have a more relevant and broad data set.
Make sure to check the path of the file stored in your computer and to update the path in the code for it to run
